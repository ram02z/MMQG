# Question Filtering

This Python package provides functionality that allows the system to filter the questions generated by the model by relevancy to the source material, that is, the lecture video and corresponding slides.

## Project Structure
`filtering-pipeline`: Offers functionality for calculating cosine similarity between text embeddings, allowing the filtering of questions based on a retention rate and similarity threshold.

`video_processing`: Provides features for extracting transcript chunks from a video lecture, aligning them with timestamps using the lecture video and corresponding slides.
